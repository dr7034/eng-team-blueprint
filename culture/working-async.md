# Async Ownership and Escalation

## Task Transparency and Updates

- Updating Linear with accurate, timely status is mandatory.
- Missed or stale updates are a red flag and reduce team trust.
- Use Linear as your real-time source of truth for all assigned work.

## Handling Escalations

- Flag blockers and risks as soon as you identify them.
- Use your team’s Slack channels and Linear comments to communicate issues early.
- For urgent or unresolved blockers, escalate immediately using PagerDuty:
  - Choose **Engineering Ops** or **Sales** based on the nature of the issue.
- Follow escalation paths: direct manager → domain leads → engineering leadership.
- Do not wait for sync meetings to escalate critical blockers.

## Async Decision Making

- Document rationale and decisions directly in tickets or relevant threads.
- Set clear expectations on response times for async approvals or feedback.
- If consensus stalls, escalate or involve a decision owner promptly.

## Managing Cross-Team Dependencies

- Communicate dependencies clearly and proactively.
- Ensure your updates enable other teams to act without delay.
- Take ownership of follow-ups and reminders on cross-team tasks.

## Measuring Async Effectiveness

- Track ticket update frequency and responsiveness.
- Monitor meeting load reduction and velocity improvements.
- Use these metrics to identify friction points and improve workflows.

## Onboarding and Training

- Provide new team members with async work guidelines and resources.
- Pair new hires with a mentor experienced in async workflows.
- Encourage gradual immersion and feedback on async practices.

## Cultural Reinforcement

- Establish async rituals: written standups, async retrospectives, no-meeting days.
- Lead by example with clear, concise async communication.
- Celebrate wins that come from effective async collaboration.
