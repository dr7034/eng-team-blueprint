# Onboarding Guide

## Overview

This guide outlines the first two weeks for new engineers joining the team, balancing initial synchronous face-time with rapid transition to async ownership and ops exposure.

---

## Day 1-2: Intensive Setup & Face-time

- **Pair programming sessions** with assigned buddy or manager to set up development environment and tools.
- Ensure access to all necessary systems (code repos, CI/CD, Slack, Linear, documentation).
- Introduce company culture and async communication principles.
- Clarify expectations for task ownership and updates in Linear.

---

## Days 3-5: Small Scoped Tasks & Ownership

- Assign personalized small backlog tasks scoped to be completed within this period.
- Encourage early ownership: escalate blockers promptly, tag relevant stakeholders.
- Reinforce async communication best practices and real-time updates in Linear.
- Begin shadowing operations team with clear deliverables:
  - Write a one-pager or Loom video explaining one escalation case.
  - Document one playbook step in the knowledge base.

---

## Days 6-10: Operations Exposure & Autonomous Work

- Continue ops shadowing with concrete deliverables as above.
- Support autonomous task management aligned with sprint cycles.
- Promote proactive communication about progress and blockers.
- Regular check-ins for feedback and guidance, minimizing sync dependency.
- Target transition to 90% async work with fewer than 2 sync check-ins per week by Day 10.

---

## Accountability & Protocols

- **Updating Linear in real-time is non-optional.**  
  Failure to keep tasks up-to-date will be flagged during 1:1s and reflects poor ownership.
- **Escalation triggers:**  
  If stuck on a problem for more than 30 minutes without progress, escalate immediately via PagerDuty or assigned channels.
- Use escalation channels for blockers to avoid paralysis and enable timely resolution.

---

## Success Metrics & Fail Conditions

- Environment fully set up and first PR submitted by Day 3.  
  _Fail condition:_ No PR or environment ready by Day 4 triggers manager intervention.
- Demonstrated proactive escalation and task updates by Day 5.
- Completed ops deliverables (one-pager / playbook step) by Day 10.
- Working primarily asynchronously by Day 10 with minimal sync meetings.

---

## Support

- Buddy / manager available for pairing and questions.
- Documentation and async guides accessible.
- Clear escalation paths for blockers and ops issues.

---

## Notes

- This plan is flexible and personalized depending on engineer experience and working style.
- Cultural reinforcement around ownership and async communication is essential.
