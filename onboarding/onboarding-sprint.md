## 1. First Three Days: Intensive FaceTime & Setup

**Day 1: Environment Setup & Pairing**

- Pair with your buddy or manager to fully set up your development environment.
- Deep dive into core codebases and architecture with live walkthroughs.
- Read the async communication guide together and clarify questions.
- Discuss expectations on async updates and ownership.
- Assign your first small backlog task for hands-on practice.

**Day 2: Shadowing & Ops Exposure**

- Spend time with Engineering Ops or Sales Ops teams to understand workflows.
- Attend sync meetings, shadow triage and incident responses.
- Review tooling and escalation protocols live.
- Continue paired development on onboarding tasks.

**Day 3: Guided Independent Work & Feedback**

- Work independently on assigned tasks with real-time support available.
- Submit your first PR for review.
- Participate in async code review discussions.
- Provide feedback on onboarding and clarify any blockers.

## 2. Next Two Days: Extended Ops Exposure

- Continue shadowing Ops teams to solidify understanding of escalation and incident workflows.
- Attend scheduled syncs relevant to your role (incident reviews, ops meetings).
- Practice escalating and tagging blockers as per protocol.
- Engage in async reflection and status updates.

## 3. Sprint & Async Transition Plan

- After initial face-time focus, transition gradually to async-first communication and sprint cycles.
- Tasks become more independent but remain small and MVP-scoped.
- Linear updates and ticket management are mandatory and real-time.
- Escalate blockers immediately using PagerDuty or designated ops channels.

## 4. Ownership & Accountability

- Early emphasis on asking questions live and learning context.
- Transition quickly to independent ownership of tasks and async communication.
- Ownership means proactively updating, escalating, and collaborating.
- Balance autonomy with timely communication and escalation.

## 5. Buddy & Manager Role

- Provide daily synchronous check-ins during first 3 days.
- Support shadowing and learning ops workflows.
- Monitor progress and adjust ramp-up pace as needed.
- Transition to async 1:1s and coaching as independence grows.

---

## 6. Early Success Metrics

- Fully operational dev environment by end of Day 1.
- Active participation in live pairing and shadowing sessions.
- Merged PRs for onboarding tasks within first 3 days.
- Demonstrated understanding of ops escalation workflows.
- Gradual transition from synchronous support to async task ownership.
