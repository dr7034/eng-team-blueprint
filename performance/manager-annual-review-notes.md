# Annual Review Briefing Document

This briefing is designed to prepare both managers and individual contributors (ICs) for an effective, fair, and actionable annual review process grounded in ownership culture and objective assessment.

---

## Purpose

- Promote **extreme ownership**: Encourage ICs to take full accountability for their work, challenges, and growth.
- Provide a **structured, unbiased framework** for evaluation, minimizing rating inflation and bias.
- Drive **clear development focus** through measurable outcomes and collaborative reflection.
- Maintain alignment with the company’s **engineering progression framework** and business goals.

---

## Roles & Responsibilities

### Individual Contributor (IC)

- Complete Sections 1–5 before the review meeting with honest self-reflection.
- Focus on examples of ownership, impact, and barriers.
- Prepare to discuss goals and needed support.
- Use scores as a tool for growth, not as judgment.

### Manager

- Prepare Sections 6–10 based on observations, data, and conversations.
- Calibrate ratings against peers and past reviews; justify extremes.
- Encourage open dialogue to validate scores and set clear next steps.
- Ensure review aligns with progression framework and organizational needs.

---

## Scoring Guidelines

- Use the 0–5 scale consistently: 0 = no signal or poor performance, 5 = outstanding.
- Avoid clustering scores in the middle; push to differentiate performance clearly.
- Calibration is mandatory: review outlier scores and discuss with peers if needed.
- Apply the scoring summary and interpretation as a **development tool**, not a promotion formula.

---

## Preparing for the Review Meeting

- ICs should come prepared with examples of ownership and measurable impact.
- Managers should gather quantitative data (project metrics, peer feedback) and qualitative notes.
- Identify areas where ownership principles were exemplified or missed.
- Be ready to discuss blockers transparently and co-create solutions.

---

## Conducting the Review

- Start with IC’s self-assessment to set a collaborative tone.
- Discuss each section with concrete examples.
- Address discrepancies in ratings with empathy and data.
- Highlight ownership behaviors: responsibility, initiative, transparency.
- Set clear, measurable goals with timelines.
- Agree on support and remove blockers to foster growth.

---

## Post-Review Follow-Up

- Document agreed goals and action plans clearly.
- Schedule regular check-ins to track progress on ownership and impact.
- Use feedback loops to refine future reviews and calibration.

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Using the review as a punitive tool rather than a development conversation.
- Allowing rating inflation or deflation without calibration.
- Ignoring behavioral aspects of ownership.
- Focusing on task completion over measurable business impact.
- Neglecting to set clear, actionable next steps.

---

## Final Notes

This process is designed to empower engineers to take ownership of their growth and contribution while providing managers with a reliable framework to guide and measure that journey. The balance of objective scoring and qualitative feedback creates a strong foundation for meaningful development aligned to company goals.
