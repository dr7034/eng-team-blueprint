## Key Principles

- **Be timely** — Give feedback regularly, not just in formal reviews.
- **Use examples** — Tie feedback to specific actions and impact.
- **Focus on behaviours** — Avoid personality judgments; target observable actions.
- **Balance strengths & improvements** — Recognize wins and growth areas.
- **Set clear, actionable goals** — Define what success looks like next.
- **Invite dialogue** — Encourage questions and collaborative problem-solving.
- **Align to progression** — Link feedback to the engineer’s current level and growth path.

## Structuring 2-Way Feedback Conversations

### 1. Start with Strengths

- Highlight specific recent examples of impact, technical skills, or behaviours.
- Ask: _“What do you feel went well recently?”_

### 2. Explore Areas for Improvement

- Frame challenges as growth opportunities, backed by examples.
- Ask: _“Where do you feel stuck or want to improve?”_

### 3. Set Clear, Measurable Goals

- Use SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound).
- Example: “Increase code coverage by 10% on feature X by end of next sprint.”
- Ensure goals align with progression framework expectations for next level.

### 4. Co-Create an Action Plan

- Discuss resources, support, and steps needed.
- Agree on milestones and check-in dates.
- Ask: _“What do you need from me or the team to succeed?”_

### 5. Confirm Commitment and Understanding

- Recap goals and next steps.
- Get verbal agreement and any concerns.
- Document the plan for reference.
