## How To Use This Template

This document is designed to guide a structured conversation between the engineer and their manager focused on growth, ownership, and alignment to company goals.

- **Engineer:** Complete Sections 1–4 and 6–7 before your meeting with honest self-reflection.
- **Manager:** Review engineer’s inputs and prepare feedback. Use Sections 5, 8–12 to provide guidance, capture agreed actions, and note support needed.
- **Collaborate:** Use the meeting to discuss challenges, opportunities, and stretch assignments, and update the plan live or shortly after.
- **Iterate:** Revisit regularly (monthly or quarterly) to track progress, adjust goals, and ensure continuous growth and accountability.

This process helps create transparency, focus, and shared ownership of development plans that align with broader engineering progression frameworks.
