## Usage & Cadence

- **Scorecard Frequency:** Complete the scorecard at least once per formal review cycle (e.g., quarterly or biannually).
- Use scorecards as ongoing input for weekly or monthly 1:1s, but full scoring is recommended during major reviews.
- Regular calibration sessions should align manager scoring standards across the team to reduce bias.
- Encourage managers and ICs to keep ongoing notes and examples throughout the period to support accurate scoring.
