## Usage Notes

- Score each question 0–5 reflecting signal strength (0 = no signal, 5 = strong).
- Multiply the section weights implicitly by number of questions; total scores calculated automatically.
- Manager calibration is critical to reduce bias — justify extremes and align with peers.
- Use scores and comments as inputs for growth conversations, not automatic decisions.
- The goal is clear ownership, measurable impact, and actionable next steps.
