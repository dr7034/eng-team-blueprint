## Helpful Hints for Using This Framework

- **Managers:** Use this as a guide, not a checklist. Context matters—discuss with engineers how they demonstrate impact, skills, and behaviours.
- **Engineers:** Take ownership of your growth by self-assessing honestly and discussing development areas with your manager.
- **Feedback:** Make feedback specific, actionable, and tied to progression criteria. Avoid vague “good job” or “needs improvement” comments.
- **Calibration:** Regularly calibrate progression discussions across teams to ensure consistency and fairness.
- **Flexibility:** Adapt scope and expectations for different domains, disciplines, and individual circumstances.
- **Culture:** Embed company values explicitly to make the framework motivational and human, not just technical.
- **Documentation:** Link this framework to career conversations, performance reviews, and onboarding to create a cohesive development journey.
- **Review:** Update the framework periodically to reflect evolving company goals, tech stack, and best practices.
