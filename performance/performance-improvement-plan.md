## How To Use This Performance Improvement Plan

1. **Set Clear Expectations:** Use the Performance Concerns and Improvement Goals sections to precisely communicate where performance gaps exist and what success looks like.

2. **Collaborate on the Plan:** Discuss the PIP with the employee to ensure mutual understanding and buy-in. Emphasize that this is a partnership focused on growth and ownership.

3. **Provide Support:** Identify and deliver coaching, training, or resources needed to help the employee improve. Regular check-ins should be scheduled and documented.

4. **Track Progress Objectively:** Use the Check-in Schedule to assess milestones and provide honest, actionable feedback. Adjust support as necessary.

5. **Maintain Transparency and Accountability:** Keep documentation clear and accessible. The employee should understand that ownership means taking full responsibility for meeting these goals.

6. **Decide Next Steps:** At the final review, evaluate if the employee has met the criteria. If yes, discuss next development steps; if not, proceed according to company policy.

Remember, this plan is about enabling success through ownership, not punishment. Clarity, consistency, and communication are key.
